# Tram-One Express

> This setup requires `npx`, which should be included in `Node.js`, To install the latest version of `Node.js`, go here: https://nodejs.org/en/

The fastest and best way to install Tram-One is by using Tram-One Express,
a dedicated generator for building single-page apps using Tram-One.


It comes with example code, scripts, and tests to help you get started!

```bash
npx tram-one-express <app-name>
```


This will give you a [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) project configured with
everything you need to start development on your machine. After running the
above command on your machine, cd into the new directory, and run

```bash
npm start
```

You will see a web application with a title bar, and some simple text. Feel free
from here to play around, build new components, and remove existing ones.
